# Recursion
In this exercise we'll write some recursive functions, that we will base on simple mathematical examples.

## Factorial
A factorial is the sum of all positive numbers up to the given input. Design a method that queries an integer number from the user and calculates it's factorial. Do this with recursion instead of a loop or repetitive code.
* Output the result in the following style:
  * Result: 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
  
## Triangle
Imaging a triangle made of squares. The top row has one square, the next row has 2 square, and so on. Calculate and print the total number of in the triangle has for a given number of rows.
e.g. triangle(2) would have 3 squares, while triangle(3) would have 6 squares
* Optional: build the same function in a tail-recursive manner

## Palindrome
Use a recursive function to check if a given input is a palindrome. Palindromes are words that read the same backward or forward. e.g. mom or radar
